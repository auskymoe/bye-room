# Python-Practice
These are a couple of small projects where I'm messing around with new concepts/libraries
## type-left-hand
This is a pretty simple application that lets you make new binds on your keyboard. It currently doesn't work in things like games, as the keystrokes aren't suppressed e.g space+a will still type " a" but then will be quickly followed by backspace twice and then whatever letter space+a was programmed to output.
## mearning
I used Python lists to implement Q-learning for a token collector in an array. So far after 50 episodes it gets to be 40% faster than random in finding a token in a 5x5 array.
